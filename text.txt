working directory -> stagging area -> local repository -> remote repository
test-project      -> git add       -> git commit       -> git push


make changes -> git add (add the changes) -> git commit (commit the changes to local repo) -> git push (upload the changes to the remote repo)

eg, if you teammates have updated and pushed a lot of changes in remote repo -> you want to get all the changes and updates to your local repo -> git pull 

git pull
